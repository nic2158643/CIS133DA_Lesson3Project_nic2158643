    <p1>Due to technology today, it is getting more enhanced, there are a lot of things to learn just to get the hang of it.
        It doesn't seem to matter what is being produced, some people seem to be having ideas that they think are very thorough to society.
        Yes, some of the pieces today seem to be having a great distinguish in helping people out, while others have absolutely no meaning.
        The main point is, there takes a lot of analysis and possible coding to develope these specific parts of technology, but as said before, 
        how is it going to help society. There is definitely a lot to learn when it comes to programming these different products, especially computers
        and other specific devices. They are going to continue to evolve and yes, they are going to receive new features and applications the more they,
        come out with new products. I'm just curious if these inventors are going to reach a stopping point at some point.</p1>

    <p2>I am one of those regular everyday kinds of students that is working really hard to earn my bachelors degree in criminal justice. I originally
        started at Phoenix College back in 2013, and yes it did take me a while to earn my associates of science, but it all paid off when I transferred 
        to the university. I took a bunch of extra courses at PC, because I wanted to learn as much as my brain could take. After I transferred to the university,
        I found out that I was actually ahead of the game from all the extra courses I took for fun. I never was completely the greatest at working with computers,
        but I still try to learn as much as possible, because you can never learn too much or too little.</p2>
